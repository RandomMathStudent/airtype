# The Airtype Project 
# Vite + React + Typescript 


The idea of this project is for me to learn js and a little bit about CV. The end goal is build something that allows the user to have a camera of some sort pointed down at their hands, and for them to be able to type without a keyboard purely based of the webcam display. 

Furthering this eventually these are some features I want to include: 
 - SLM or somesort of learning that allows better decision making based on common letter combinations, correctional learning etc
 - geometric adaptation so the view need not be birds eye, and the use can have their hands in different orientations


The bulk of the project will revolve around typescript and the Mediapipes CV package.
